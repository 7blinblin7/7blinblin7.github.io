##java运行环境
###JVM
java是独立于平台的语言。如今，计算机已联网以协同工作。Java 被设计为在任何平台上运行。只需编写一次程序，即可将源程序编译为一种特殊类型的目标代码，称为字节码。然后，字节码可以在任何具有 Java 虚拟机 （JVM） 的计算机上运行，JVM 是 Java 字节码的软件解释器
Java 文件经过编译后变成 .class 字节码文件字节码文件通过类加载器被搬运到 JVM 虚拟机中虚拟机主要的 5 大块：方法区，堆都为线程共享区域，有线程安全问题，栈和本地方法栈和计数器都是独享区域，不存在线程安全问题，而 JVM 的调优主要就是围绕堆，栈两大块进行
##为什么选择java
###jdk
Since JDK 9, Oracle releases a new version of JDK every 6
months (on Mar and Sep). Before that, it was normally
between 2 to 5 years for each new release.
Each release has a lifespan about 6 months until the next
release and will not receive further updates except Long-
Term-Support (LTS) version.
 Current LTS release is JDK 8, 11 and 17
JDK vs OpenJDK
From Java 11 forward, they are fundamentally the same in terms
of features. All features available in JDK build is also available in
OpenJDK build.
JDK i not free for commercial use. Oracle provides LTS.
OpenJDK is free for commercial use, but receives no LTS.
Company needs to upgrade to the next release every 6
months.
###优点
1. Simple and Object-Oriented (simplify from C++)
2. Distributed (support network programming)
3. Interpreted, portable and architecture-neutral
4. Robust and secure (exception handling, digital signature)
5. High-performance (hotspot technology)Although it is suffered from the performance degradation of bytecode
interpretation, some analysis show that Java’s performance is quite close to native code nowadays
6. Multi-threaded (simultaneous tasks)
7. Dynamic (no installation, no recompilation, load-on-the-fly)
